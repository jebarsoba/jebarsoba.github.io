  All my life I have been guided by my two passions: computers and music. After leaving school I was torn by them and even though I started Engineering, I shifted to music school. During that time, I earned my living as a professional musician and as an IT technician. This indecision was the reason for my late start in the corporate IT world. In my mid 20s, I joined a well-known telco, as a developer. At that moment, I realized that was my environment. Together with this insight, some university professors also showed me the passion with which this job can be done and inspired me to pursue a career in the software development field.
